            <h3>Vince's bio </h3>
            <h6>by Bri</h6>
            <p>While we both are from cold, Midwestern places, Vince grew up in one that’s slightly chillier &mdash; Minnesota. He went to UW-Madison (we surprisingly never met!) and while he studied to go to medical school, his heart was in building new things and solving complex software problems. If he’s not learning a new coding language or convincing me that we really needed this new tech thing he bought, he’s off climbing rocks and planning new adventures for us to go on.</p>
            <p>From the first minute I met Vince’s eyes and he silently stared back at me, I knew that 1) I’d get to talk all the time and 2) he was a really special person. When you meet Vince, it wouldn’t be a stretch to assume he’s quiet and thoughtful. Spending more time with him, you quickly realize that his quiet nature is really him thinking a mile a minute and then has very strong opinions to share. With all of our banter and all of the laughs, I’d never choose anyone else but him.</p>
            <p>Vince is a million tiny, happy moments all rolled into one exceptional person.</p>

            <h3>Bri's bio </h3>
            <h6>by Vince</h6>
            <p>Brianna once went to school for geological engineering, until she realized her love for people eclipsed her love for rocks. She takes this love around the world with her to all the cities, countries and continents she visits, which I've completely lost track of at this point. She then returns to her work which somehow always involves building tight-knit international communities of people who quickly become her remote family. Whether it's giving the most thoughtful gifts and notes, or cooking the most delicious meals and desserts to share, Brianna's love for others is present in her every interaction.</p>
            <p>Behind her unforgettable personality is an insightful and passionate drive that never ceases to impress me. When Brianna sets her mind to something, she will definitely find a way to make it happen. Not only that, she will accomplish it in such a tactful way that you will barely realize it's happening until it's done, leaving you with just a quiet sense of awe. There is nobody else I would want more by my side on this adventure of life.</p>

            <h3>How we met</h3>
            <p>We've been together for 4 and a half years (almost 5 by wedding time!), although neither of us can keep track of the dates. While there have been a few moves in that time around the Bay, we originally met in Mountain View while working for the same company. Vince moved out here to work on technically challenging problems after college, and after Brianna traveled, she moved out here too! As hard as Vince tried to ignore Brianna and pretend like he didn’t like her loud and cheery attitude, he eventually caved in and acknowledged that he really liked her. Vince even changed his night-owl ways, and started working during the day and sleeping at night so we could spend time together like a normal couple. We love to go exploring every chance we get &mdash; Vince drives, Brianna gives terrible directions, and eventually we make it somewhere new.</p>
            <p>After many adventures around Northern California, Vince planned a back trip to one of our favorite places, the Whale Watch Inn. While out exploring the area, we went to one of Brianna’s favorite rock locations, bowling ball beach. Vince proposed to Bri at this beach, asking if she would like to carry another rock around with her. Giggling at Vince’s charm and wit, Brianna said yes (and then asked him to keep proposing because she liked it so much.)</p>

            As soon as we were engaged, we knew we wanted to have our celebration in a new, far-off destination for our friends and family. We both love to travel, and we’re excited to have a new adventure with the people we love! We know Portugal is a long way to travel, but we hope you can join us for a week or two, long weekend, or even just a few days. We’d love to explore a new city, hang out at the beach, and enjoy delicious food with each of you while we’re in this beautiful country together.

We suggest searching for flights to bigger airports in Europe and catching a plane to Lisbon from there. We really like <a href="https://www.exitfares.com/" target="_blank">ExitFares</a>, and they sent you an email every day with a bunch of flights on sale! Otherwise, prices will likely increase as we approach tourist time (spring / summer,) so don’t wait too long! Also, rumor is that flights are cheapest on Wednesdays.</p>
